/**
 * CSS Cascade Layer Declarations
 *
 * Defines the order of CSS layers for explicit cascade control.
 * Layers are applied in order of declaration (earlier = lower priority).
 *
 * Layer hierarchy:
 * 1. reset    - Browser normalization (lowest priority)
 * 2. tokens   - Design system variables (colors, breakpoints, spacing)
 * 3. base     - Element defaults (html, body, headings, links, animations)
 * 4. components - Component-specific styles
 * 5. utilities - Helper classes
 * 6. themes   - Theme overrides (highest priority)
 *
 * This explicit ordering means:
 * - Reset styles won't accidentally override components
 * - Theme overrides always win, regardless of import order
 * - Component styles can rely on base styles being available
 * - No more specificity wars or !important hacks
